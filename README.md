# CRGunsAndEquipmentMod
!!!THIS MOD REQUIRES Combat Realism!!!

This mod add a number of guns, equipment and tweaks to the Combat Realism mod.  

Many guns added in this mod are based off real world weapons, as well as using information from them to determine the stats (Bulk, Mass, Sway, ShotSpread, AimEfficiency, ext) in the game. It does rework the base weapons to be in line to these changes as well.  There is a txt file in the mod folder that give info on how these stat were determine and how to add your own weapons that will fit the changes made.

The equipment added are a new types of armour that fills a gap between the Combat Realism composite vest and the power armour and an exosuit which lets your pawn carry a lot more.  

The main tweak come in the form of how armour is made.  This mod add a new category called bullet resistant fabric and places Synthread, Dvilstrand, Hyperweave and two new fabrics(Nycatra Fiber and Pacdex) into this catagory.  Each fabric has a different set of stats and by making the armour out of a certain type you can tailor your pawns armour to your liking. There is also a way to craft all types of bullet resistant fabric except Hyperweave. Stat and changes for these fabrics are in a txt file in the mod folder as well as how to craft them.

Also added a new texture for the composite vest to better distinguish between it and the armor vest.  As well as added a worn weight to all clothing. 

Another tweak is the ability to craft Neutroamine from FSX.  This addon was inspired by "Chemicals extraction and Neutroamine crafting" mod by ShadowTani and he is given all credit for the idea of using stuff from Boomalope to make Neutroamine. Go look at his mod it is a good mod and a creative idea.

Yet another tweak is the Shooting skill effects a how fast a pawn can reload a weapon.

Some more tweaks are backpacks now let the pawns carry more weight as well as bulk.  This was done to give backpack some more uses, as in they can help you take more stuff on caravans.  I also made the backpacks and tactical vest be made from stuff so you can have coloured vests and backparks.

By default and changes to the weapons and ammo change the balance of this mod compare to that of Combat Realism.  This means some weapon may be just better than other in certain roles (which is true in the really word). The cost of the weapons and ammo in terms of silver, the work to make and stuff used to make them has also change to be more in line with the way items are priced in vanilla Rimworld, as well as a way to balance out the weapons, meaning that weapons that are "better" tend to cost more when compared to one another (Note feedback on this is needed).

Full Credit to NoImageAvailable, skyarkhangel and anyone else who helped make and maintain the Combat Realism mod. Without them I would not have made this mod and would have missed out on the many hours spend playing Rimworld with their mod Thank you =)
